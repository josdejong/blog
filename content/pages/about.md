I'm Jos de Jong, living and working in Rotterdam, the Netherlands.
I'm happily married with the nicest girl in the world,
and we have a lovely little girl and a boy to take care of.
I believe God created this marvelous world
where we can live, love, discover, and develop.

I've studied at Delft University of Technology, and have a Bachelor
Mechanical Engineering, and a Master Systems and Control.
After my study I've worked in ICT and automation, and am currently working
as a Software Engineer at Almende, a Dutch research company specialized in
information and communication technologies.

I'm a passionate programmer, both at work and in my spare time.
I'm pragmatic and have a lot of attention for details.
Always overflowing with great ideas to work on
(which tend to pop up at times I should sleep or when taking a shower).
I have 20 years of programming experience and am familiar with languages such
as a various Basic languages, C++, Matlab, PLC programming Java, Android,
Kotlin, PHP, Python, R, JavaScript and node.js, HTML, CSS, SQL, NoSQL, GraphQL.
I'm always looking around for new tools, techniques, and languages to make
programming even more fun.
I enjoy the creative process that programming is, especially these moments
where you finally figure out the right way to express something complicated
in a clear and easy to understand way.

Things I'm interested in include modeling of dynamic systems, mathematics,
robotics, programming, automation, distributed systems, machine learning,
software agent technology, networks, web applications, and more.
There is just so much interesting stuff to work on!
