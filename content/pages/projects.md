## Tabular-JSON

Tabular-JSON is a data format. It is a superset of JSON, adding CSV-like tables and optional quotes. It is:

- A replacement for CSV without its ambiguities and limitation of tabular data structures
- A replacement for JSON without its verbosity
- A replacement for NDJSON without its verbosity

Tabular-JSON aims to be just as simple as JSON and CSV. It combines the best of JSON, CSV, and NDJSON, but without their drawbacks. It is human-readable, compact, and supports rich data structures and streaming. The aim of Tabular-JSON is to be a data format, not a configuration format.

Website: https://tabular-json.org/

Here an example of Tabular-JSON data:

```text
{
  name: rob,
  hobbies: [
    swimming,
    biking
  ],
  friends: ---
    id, name,  address.city, address.street
    2,  joe,   New York,     "1st Ave"
    3,  sarah, Washington,   "18th Street NW"
  ---,
  address: {
    city: New York,
    street: "1st Ave"
  }
}
```

And here a table at root level (the rows are streamable):

```text
id, name,  address.city, address.street
2,  joe,   New York,     "1st Ave"
3,  sarah, Washington,   "18th Street NW"
```
